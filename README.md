## Technical choices:

**- Project creation:**
  
  I created the project using create next-app (https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app). The Next version used was 14, and the project uses the new concepts and features of this version.

**- Styles:**

  For the styling of the project, I used the **tailwindcss** framework. Because it has a very good integration with the new features of NextJS (like Server-Side Rendering, for example).
  I also used **tailwind-merge** and **clsx** libraries for merging and overriding classes when necessary, so that componentization becomes easier.

**- Code styling:**

  For pattern of project's code, I used the eslint and prettier libraries, so that coding rules and patterns could be implemented.


## Main technologies used in the project:

* [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
* [TypesCript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
* [Clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx)
